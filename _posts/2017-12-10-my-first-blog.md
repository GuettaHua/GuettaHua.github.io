## my first blog
A **developer** needs a blog.  
It seems I need a more efficient and systematic way to record my knowledge. Also record my life.  
Yes, I am a bit sad at this time. Cuz I failed and failed in the past three months.

just take some time to clean your knowledge system.  
on the other hand, it is necessary to give a detailed record for your project.  
Two things I am thinking about recently are inwards and outwards confidence, and find and use your advantage.
